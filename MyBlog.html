          <h3 class="mt-5">BEST CUNDA RESTAURANTS: TALENTS, FISHERIES, BARS</h3> <br>
          <p>
            Cunda carries the "let's drink and get better" bayonet of the gastronomy movement in Balıkesir. :) It is the most enjoyable (and of course the most expensive) place you can go to pamper yourself in Balıkesir with its exchange flavors, rows of taverns, seafront fishermen and new generation restaurants.

          <h3 class="mt-5">GÖKÇETEPE – YATAKKAYA WATERFALL ROUTE, YALOVA</h3> <br>
          <p>
            Here's another green weekend offer from our "Imdat Beton" line: Gökçetepe- Bedkaya Waterfall Track. In this article, we both gave the route details and talked about what else you can do here while you are in Yalova.

          <h3 class="mt-5">BEST HONEYMOON HOTELS – ROMANTIC & FEELING SPECIAL PLACES</h3> <br>
          <p>
            The most romantic advice we can give you is to choose boutique hotels with few rooms and a unique texture, rather than hotels that have turned into tourism factories on your honeymoon. Thus, you will both feel much more special and have an experience worthy of your honeymoon.

          <h3 class="mt-5">BAY & BEACHES OF ÇEŞME</h3> <br>
          <p>
            Çeşme's coves, public beaches, beach clubs, and even pools overlooking the sea are famous. As long as there is sea on one side. :D As we have mentioned in our other Çeşme articles, you have plenty of choices in Çeşme. From humble and civilized public beaches to the most popular beach clubs, places where you can throw yourself into the blue.

          <h3 class="mt-5">CARETTA UNCLE REVIEW</h3> <br>
          <p>
            The biggest advantage of the Caretta Uncle is that although it is a caravan with 4 beds, bathroom, toilet and kitchen, it weighs less than 750 kilos. Why is this important? In other words, you do not have to issue a license and take it for examination every year. There is nothing holding you back to hit the road. Let's show you how to use it, what is its decor, what are its features.
